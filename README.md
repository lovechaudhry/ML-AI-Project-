Anomaly Detection in CloudMonitor Data:
For this hackathon, I  challenge  to develop an anomaly detection model that can
accurately identify and categorize anomalies in CloudMonitor data. Participants will leverage
the provided dataset, which includes time series data of various CloudMonitor metrics, to build
and test their models.
Objectives:
1. Anomaly Detection:
○ Implement a model to detect anomalies in the time series data from
CloudMonitor. The model should be able to identify deviations from normal
behavior across different metrics.

2. Anomaly Categorization:
○ Categorize the detected anomalies into different types, such as temporary
spikes, gradual drifts, or sudden drops. This will help in understanding the nature
of the anomalies and their potential impact.

3. Anomaly Scoring (optional):
○ Develop a scoring system to evaluate the severity of each detected anomaly. The
scoring should reflect the potential impact on system performance or security,
helping prioritize response actions.

4. Visualization:
○ Create a visualization dashboard that displays the data, detected anomalies,
their categories, and severity scores. The dashboard should help stakeholders
easily understand and act on the anomalies detected.
○ The visualization is need to shown in notebook itself, no need to create separate
UI

5. Explainability and Interpretability(optional):
○ Provide explanations for the detected anomalies, highlighting which features or
metrics contributed most to the anomaly and why. This could involve using
explainability techniques such as SHAP values or feature importance analysis.
